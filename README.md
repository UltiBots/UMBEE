Unified MagBall Extruder & Effector
===================================

This design combines a 3D printer extruder, DeltaBot effector, and MagBall arm attachments into a compact direct drive print system capable of handling most solid and elastomeric filaments. At the core of the extruder is the powerful PG35L-048 geared stepper motor, MK8 style drive gear and spring loaded idler pinch bearing. On the top end are MagBall mounts for quick magnetic zero backlash attachment of carriage arms. On the bottom end is the popular E3D v6 or Lite6 hot end. 


## Availability
This design is being tested and refined. When proven it will be available for sale at:

## History
Our early DeltaBot printers had Bowden style extruders. This common extruder was unable to reliably print filaments like NinjaFlex. We decided to try our Micro Extruder design with our DeltaBot alpha printers and the results were impressive. So much so, we decided to incorportate the Micro Extruder design into our V-Slot based Delta printer.

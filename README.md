Unified MagBall Extruder & Effector
===================================

This design combines a 3D printer extruder, DeltaBot effector, and MagBall arm attachments into a compact direct drive print system capable of handling most solid and elastomeric filaments. At the core of the extruder is the powerful PG35L-048 geared stepper motor, MK8 style drive gear and spring loaded idler pinch bearing. On the top end are MagBall mounts for quick magnetic zero backlash attachment of carriage arms. On the bottom end is the popular E3D v6 or Lite6 hot end.

## History
Our early DeltaBot printers had Bowden style extruders. This common extruder was unable to reliably print filaments like NinjaFlex. We decided to try our Micro Extruder design with our DeltaBot alpha printers and the results were impressive. So much so, we decided to incorporate the Micro Extruder design into our V-Slot based Delta printer.

Credit to Nick Foley for pioneering with metal parts from Shapeways and our PG35L-048 geared stepper motor. Without his efforts this adaptation would not exist.
